{
    "Activity": "We can see when players last log in, but just playing is not enough. Every member should take part in **Crew Wars** to stay active. We check **Crew Wars wins** every 2 weeks. If your wins stay the same for 2 checks in a row, we will see you as **inactive** and may contact you to ask what’s going on.",
    
    "Updating Wins": "Use the `/update_wins_cw` command to update your Crew Wars wins after every event you join. Always enter your **real total number of wins**, not just how many you got in one event. Make sure your number is correct — we also **check wins manually** to keep everything fair. If you make a mistake, message a staff member to fix it.",
    
    "Absence": "If you cannot play for a while (holiday, school, or other reasons), please **message a staff member** and tell us. We will mark you as away so you are not counted as inactive.",
    
    "In-Game Behavior": "Be **kind and respectful** to other players. What you do shows what our crew is like. Do not be toxic or rude. If there is a problem, talk to a leader or mod instead of starting fights.",
    
    "Leaving the Crew": "You can play however you want! If you want to leave, start a new crew, or join another one, that’s okay — just **tell us first**. Leaving without saying anything is seen as disrespectful and may get you blocked or banned.",
    
    "Crew Storage": "Storage is for **trusted, active members**. It helps everyone share and grow stronger together.\n**Rules:**\n• Return Pokémon or items after use (especially before logging out)\n• Do not trade, keep, or sell things from storage\n• Misuse can make you lose access or get banned from storage"
