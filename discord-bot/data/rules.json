    "Activity": "We can see when players last log in, but just playing is not enough.\nWe check **Crew Wars wins** every 2 weeks. If your wins stay the same for 2 checks in a row, you are seen as **inactive**.\nEvery member must join Crew Wars regularly to stay in the crew. Players who stay inactive without saying anything may be removed from the crew and Discord.",
    
    "Absence": "If you can’t play for a while (for example, because of holiday, school, or personal reasons), please **message a staff member** and let us know. We will mark you as away so you are not removed for being inactive.",
    
    "In-Game Behavior": "Be **kind and respectful** to other players. What you do shows what our crew is like.\nDo not be toxic or rude. If there is a problem, talk to a leader or mod instead of starting fights.",
    
    "Leaving the Crew": "You can play however you want! If you want to leave, start a new crew, or join another one, that’s okay—just **tell us first.**\nLeaving without saying anything is seen as disrespectful and may get you blocked or banned.",
    
    "Crew Storage": "Storage is for **trusted, active members.** It helps everyone share and grow stronger together.\n**Rules:**\n• Return Pokémon or items after use (especially before logging out)\n• Do not trade, keep, or sell things from storage\n• Misuse can make you lose access or get banned from storage"
